# Wrangle-and-Analysis-Project
In this project I gathered data from the Twitter API and a listed source of tweets and then neural network image predictions for these tweets. 
From there I organised and cleaned the data explaining each of my decisions in the process. After gathering and cleaning I then made a short analysis of 
the master dataframe and also provided a wrangle and an act report within the notebook as well as in pdf form, each as a respective file.
